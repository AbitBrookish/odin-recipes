  <h4>Pho is a Vietnamese dish consisting of broth, rice noodles, herbs,
    and meat.
  </h4>
    <p>Making your own fabulous bowl of Vietnamese pho at home is not hard, 
      all you need is a straightforward recipe, a few secrets and a nice big stockpot. 
      We realize our recipe may look daunting, but this is quite simple to do and 
      there is a lot of inactive time while you wait for the broth (weâ€™ve just been 
      extra tedious to share everything we know).</p>
