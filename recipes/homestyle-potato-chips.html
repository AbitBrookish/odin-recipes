  <h4>Homestyle Potato Chips made from fried, thin-sliced potatoes.</h4>
    <p>Homemade potato chips are fun and easy. Guaranteed they won't last long! A food 
      processor with a slicing attachment is very helpful for slicing the potatoes. 
      Experiment with the thickness; you may like them thicker or thinner. I like to use olive oil for 
      frying, but you can use safflower, corn, or peanut oil as well as vegetable oil.</p><br>
