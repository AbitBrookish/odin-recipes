# odin-recipes
HTML project through theodinproject.
This project is meant to apply the basics of what I've learned about HTML formats(doctype, html, header, body, paragraph, etc.), and use that knowlegde to create a barebones recipe website with 3 recipes. Those recipes have their own links, images, descriptions and instructions.
