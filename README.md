# odin-recipes
HTML project through theodinproject.
<br />
This project is meant to apply the basics of what I've learned about HTML formats(doctype, html, header, body, paragraph, etc.), and use that knowlegde to create a barebones recipe website with 3 recipes. Those recipes have their own links, images, descriptions and instructions.

The css file is a small exercise in using background colors, colors, selectors, id and class tags, and both font-size and font-family.
